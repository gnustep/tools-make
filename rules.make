# 2. so that if you type `make install INSTALL_AS_USER=nicola' in a directory,

# Warning - if you want to hardcode a INSTALL_AS_USER in a GNUmakefile, then
# you shouldn't rely on us to pass it down to subGNUmakefiles - you should
# rather hardcode INSTALL_AS_USER in all your GNUmakefiles (or better have
# a makefile fragment defining INSTALL_AS_USER in the top-level and include
# it in all GNUmakefiles) - otherwise what happens is that if you go in a
# subdirectory and type 'make install' there, it will not get the 
# INSTALL_AS_USER from the higher level GNUmakefile, so it will install with

# The difference between ADDITIONAL_XXXFLAGS and AUXILIARY_XXXFLAGS is the
# following:
#
#  ADDITIONAL_XXXFLAGS are set freely by the user GNUmakefile
#
#  AUXILIARY_XXXFLAGS are set freely by makefile fragments installed by
#                     auxiliary packages.  For example, gnustep-db installs
#                     a gdl.make file.  If you want to use gnustep-db in
#                     your tool, you `include $(GNUSTEP_MAKEFILES)/gdl.make'
#                     and that will add the appropriate flags to link against
#                     gnustep-db.  Those flags are added to AUXILIARY_XXXFLAGS.
#
# Why can't ADDITIONAL_XXXFLAGS and AUXILIARY_XXXFLAGS be the same variable ?
# Good question :-) I'm not sure but I think the original reason is that 
# users tend to think they can do whatever they want with ADDITIONAL_XXXFLAGS,
# like writing 
# ADDITIONAL_XXXFLAGS = -Verbose
# (with a '=' instead of a '+=', thus discarding the previous value of
# ADDITIONAL_XXXFLAGS) without caring for the fact that other makefiles 
# might need to add something to ADDITIONAL_XXXFLAGS.
#
# So the idea is that ADDITIONAL_XXXFLAGS is reserved for the users to
# do whatever mess they like with them, while in makefile fragments
# from packages we use a different variable, which is subject to a stricter 
# control, requiring package authors to always write
#
#  AUXILIARY_XXXFLAGS += -Verbose
#
# in their auxiliary makefile fragments, to make sure they don't
# override flags from different packages, just add to them.
#
# When building up command lines inside gnustep-make, we always need
# to add both AUXILIARY_XXXFLAGS and ADDITIONAL_XXXFLAGS to all
# compilation/linking/etc command.

# In exceptional conditions, you might need to want to use different compiler
# flags for a file (for example, if a file doesn't compile with optimization
# turned on, you might want to compile that single file with optimizations
# turned off).  gnustep-make allows you to do this - you can specify special 
# flags to be used when compiling a *specific* file in two ways - 
#
# xxx_FILE_FLAGS (where xxx is the file name, such as main.m) 
#                are special compilation flags to be used when compiling xxx
#
# xxx_FILE_FILTER_OUT_FLAGS (where xxx is the file name, such as mframe.m)
#                is a filter-out make pattern of flags to be filtered out 
#                from the compilation flags when compiling xxx.
#
# Typical examples:
#
# Disable optimization flags for the file NSInvocation.m:
# NSInvocation.m_FILE_FILTER_OUT_FLAGS = -O%
#
# Disable optimization flags for the same file, and also remove 
# -fomit-frame-pointer:
# NSInvocation.m_FILE_FILTER_OUT_FLAGS = -O% -fomit-frame-pointer
