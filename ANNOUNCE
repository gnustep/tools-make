Announcement
************

The GNUstep Makefile Package version 1.7.2 is now available.

What is the GNUstep makefile package?
=====================================

   The makefile package is a simple, powerful and extensible way to
write makefiles for a GNUstep-based project.  It allows the user to
write a project without having to deal with the complex issues
associated with configuration, building, installation, and packaging.
It also allows the user to easily create cross-compiled binaries.

   Note that versions that have a odd minor release number (the second
number, y, in x.y.z) are unstable releases (like 1.5.2), which even
minor release numbers (1.4.1) are stable releases.

Changes in version `1.7.1'
==========================

   -enable-flattened (Flat directory structure) is on by default.

   * On WIN32 use HOMEPATH in preference to USERPROFILE

   * netbsd and openbsd compile fixes.
