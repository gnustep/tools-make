**************

The GNUstep Makefile Package version 2.9.0 is now available.

1.1 What is the GNUstep Makefile Package?
=========================================

The makefile package is a simple, powerful and extensible way to write
makefiles for a GNUstep-based project.  It allows the user to write a
project without having to deal with the complex issues associated with
configuration, building, installation, and packaging.  It also allows
the user to easily create cross-compiled binaries.

1.2 Changes in version '2.9.0'
==============================

   * Better check for objc runtime on Windows.

   * Split linker flags to better support partial linking: 'ALL_LDFLAGS'
     is now a combination of 'FINAL_LDFLAGS' and 'ALL_LDFLAGS'.

   * Better support for newer gcc versions.

   * Add support for storyboard files.

   * Increase autoconf version to 2.65 and make autoconf handle
     Objective-C++ and OBJCXX variables directly.

   * Fix bug that prevented ARC from getting used.

   * Link subproject object files directly instead of first merging them
     into 'subproject.o'.

   * Support building on Windows with Clang MSVC target.

   * Improve mingw64 support: for instance, adopt the triplet used by
     the mingw-w64 project rather than using the one returned by
     autoconf.  Fixes building Gorm.
