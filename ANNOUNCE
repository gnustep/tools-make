1.1 What is the GNUstep Makefile Package?
=========================================

The makefile package is a simple, powerful and extensible way to write
makefiles for a GNUstep-based project.  It allows the user to write a
project without having to deal with the complex issues associated with
configuration, building, installation, and packaging.  It also allows
the user to easily create cross-compiled binaries.

   • Added support for ASAN/LSAN builds

   • Various minor bugfixes.

   It is accompanied by gnustep-make-2.9.3.tar.gz.sig, a PGP signature
which you can validate by putting both files in the same directory and
