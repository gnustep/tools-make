The GNUstep Makefile Package version 2.0.6 is now available.

1.1 What is the GNUstep makefile package?
=========================================

The makefile package is a simple, powerful and extensible way to write
makefiles for a GNUstep-based project.  It allows the user to write a
project without having to deal with the complex issues associated with
configuration, building, installation, and packaging.  It also allows
the user to easily create cross-compiled binaries.

1.2 Changes in version `2.0.6'
==============================

   * Fixed some spurious rebuilds of plists, and framework headers.

   * Added the -enable-absolute-install-paths option for Darwin systems.

   * Install GNUstep.conf in /etc/GNUstep/GNUstep.conf on all systems.

1.3 Obtaining gnustep-make
