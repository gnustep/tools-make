The currently released version is `1.7.1'.

Changes in version `1.7.1'
==========================

   Bug fixes.

Changes in version `1.7.0'
==========================

   This version contains a major change in the location of certain
directories and installed files as detailed in the `filesystem.texi'
document. When installing this version for the first time, all old
directories and files in those directories will be moved to the new
locations automatically. However, you should update all GNUstep versions
on any machine you have them installed on in order to avoid any
incompatibilities.

   Other changes:

   * Support for preprocessed Info.plists.

Changes in version `1.6.0'
==========================

   Make now configures by default for only one system. To compile and
run GNUstep for multiple platforms from the same directory, use the
configure argument -enable-multi-platform.

   * Auto-build def file for DLLs

   * Work natively on MacOSX systems. Now use apple-apple-apple instead
     of nx-nx-nx on OSX systems.

   * More efficient checks for re-making a project.

Changes in version `1.5.1'
==========================

   * Framework support rewritten, also supports multiple names.

   * API change: Replace frameowork's xxx_TOOLS by xxx_COPY_INTO_DIR.

   * Unified link commands between libraries and frameworks
     (LIB_LINK_*).

   * New 'make strings' target for localization support.

   * Speed improvements.

   * Doesn't try to build OSX bundle on GNUstep and vice versa.

   * API change: Tools/Subproj can have resources.

   * API change: TOOL_INSTALL_DIR.

Changes in version `1.5.0'
==========================

   * Add NetBSD Elf support

Changes in version `1.4.0'
==========================

   * Update Darwin/GNU gcc and Irix targets

Changes in version `1.3.4'
==========================

   This is a first prerelease version for 1.4.

   * Use gnugc-gnu-gnu library combo for garbage collecting version.

   * Add support for -library-combo in opentool

   * Change GNUSTEP_PATHPREFIX_LIST to	GNUSTEP_PATHLIST

   * Add verbosity levels. Use make messages=yes for full messages.

Changes in version `1.3.3'
==========================

   * Recognizes XXX_STANDARD_INSTALL=no to not do installation.

   * Updated instructions for MingW/MSYS installation.

Changes in version `1.3.2'
==========================

   * Instructions for building on Windows with MSYS

   * Resolve library dependencies better on Windows

   * Fix frameworks in RPMs and DEBs

   * Continued reorganization.

Changes in version `1.3.0'
==========================

   The package has gone through an extensive reorganization to break up
each sub-make into two separate components. This allows for much
simplified code and lots of code sharing between components. As a side
effect, it also increased the speed of the code by at least a factor of
2.

   * Force shared=yes for cygwin and mingw

   * Bundles copy resources from subprojects.

   * Better resource management. Resources handled accross all project
     types.

   * Simplified and fixed user root location between make and base
     libraries.

   * Changed Apps directory to Applications

   * Fixes for MacOSX, MingW

Changes in version `1.2.1'
==========================

   * the source distribution code has been rewritten to be more general
     and extended.  Packages built using gnustep-make now automatically
     have handy targets building tarballs from sources or from CVS
     imports.

   * implemented support for auto-dependencies, which means that any
     object file automatically depends on all the header files which
     were used to build it.  Only works with newer compilers.

   * implemented INSTALL_AS_USER and INSTALL_AS_GROUP.

   * implemented a strip=yes option.

   * various bug fixes and minor improvements.

Changes in version `1.2.0'
==========================

   * The core rules and internals of gnustep-make have been
     fundamentally redesigned and rewritten.  notably, gnustep-make now
     works using only a single recursive sub-make invocation rather
     than two, which makes it consistently faster and simpler in all
     circumstances.

   * The clean rules have been heavily optimized - they no longer use
     recursive sub-make invocations at all and so they are really fast.

   * Many improvements to java support. Optimized management of nested
     classes

   * Better conformance to make conventions.

   * File specific compilation flags

   * Fixed darwin support

   * Support for C++ files.

   * Made use of library installation dir consistent with other
     installation.

   * Much improved Windows path support

Changes in version `1.0.1'
==========================

   * Support for Java tools.

   * Build GUI backend as a bundle (default).

   * Remove backend part of LIBRARY_COMBO.

   * Fixes to run on FreeBSD, Solaris.

Changes in version `1.0.0'
==========================

   * Optimizations that in many cases more than double the speed.

   * Added preliminary darwin support.

   * rpm packeing improvements.

   * Better checking for mingw and cygwin

Changes in version `0.9.2'
==========================

   * HOWTO and faq files moved from core package to here

   * Configurable GNUSTEP_LOCAL_ROOT and GNUSTEP_NETWORK_ROOT

Changes in version `0.9.1'
==========================

   Make has been reoganized so that it only relies on libraries and
other things that are necessary for the Makefile package itself. Any
libraries wanting to add extra package information can do so by
installing a make stub in the `Additional' directory. This greatly
simplifies compilation and packaging.

   * Javadoc support added.

   * debian directory added for dpkg

   * RPM support rewritten from scratch.

Changes in version `0.9.0'
==========================

   ffcall library is highly recommended for use with the GNUstep base
library. You need to have installed it prior to configuring the Makefile
package. See the INSTALL file.

   * Support for automatically generating RPM spec files.

   * Build suitable files for MacOS bundles

   * Add option for flattened directory structure.

   * LaText documentation support.

   * Added support for Frameworks

Noteworthy changes in version `0.6.6'
=====================================

   The GNUstep system libraries are now installed in a separate system
root directory (default /usr/GNUstep/System) rather than the GNUstep
root directory (default /usr/GNUstep). You can revert to the old
behavior using a configure option `--without-system-root'. We also
recommend removing any previous GNUstep versions before installing the
new one in order to avoid problems with the system finding the correct
binary and/or library.

   * Support for Windows compilation (cygwin and mingw) and DLL creation
     and usage.

   * Java support rewritten and extended.
