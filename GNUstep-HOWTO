Introduction
************

This document explains how to build the GNUstep core libraries.  The
core libraries, along with associated tools and other files provide
everything necessary for a working GNUstep system.

   In order to easily compile and debug GNUstep projects, you will need
the GNU Objective-C compiler `GCC' as well as various other GNU
packages.

   You will need at least 80Mb of hard disk space (150Mb prefered) in
order to compile the GNUstep core libraries.

Summary
*******

In order to compile the libraries, you need to compile and install the
following packages first (if you don't already have them):

   * gcc (Version 2.95 or greater, 3.0.4 or greater recommended)

   * GNU make (Version 3.75 or greater)

   * gdb (Version 6.0 or greater recommended), if you plan to do any
     debugging

   You may also need to install some of the following libraries and
packages described below. Most of these packages are optional, but some
are required.

`ffcall libraries (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)'
     This is a library that provides stack-frame handling for
     NSInvocation and NSConnection. This library is highly recommended.
     The previous builtin method for stack frame handling is no longer
     supported and may be removed in the future.  ffcall is under GNU
     GPL. As a special exception, if used in GNUstep or in derivate
     works of GNUstep, the included parts of ffcall are under GNU LGPL.

`libffi library (ALTERNATIVE RECOMMENDATION)'
     This is a library that provides stack frame handling for
     NSInvocation and NSConnection similar to ffcall.  Use this instead
     of ffcall. You don't need both.

`libxml2 (RECOMMENDED)'
     The libxml library (Version 2) is used to translate some of the
     documentation for GNUstep and to provide suport for MacOS-X
     compatible XML-based property-lists. It is recommended but not
     currently required.

`libxslt (OPTIONAL)'
     Stylesheet support for use with XML.

`openssl (OPTIONAL)'
     The openssl library is used to provide support for https
     connections by the NSURL and HSURLHandle classes.  This
     functionality is compiled as a separate bundle since the OpenSSL
     license is not compatible with GPL, and in the hopes that if
     someone writes an openssl replacement, it can quickly be used by
     creating another bundle.

`libiconv (OPTIONAL)'
     Note: Do not install this library unless you are sure you need it.
     You probably don't need it except perhaps on MinGW.  Unicode
     support functions (iconv) come with glibc version 2.1 or greater.
     If you don't have glibc (try iconv -version), you can get the
     separate libiconv library from
     <http://clisp.cons.org/~haible/packages-libiconv.html>. However,
     neither one is required to use GNUstep.

`The TIFF library (libtiff) (Version 3.4beta36 or greater) (REQUIRED)'
     The GUI library uses this to handle loading and saving TIFF images.

`The JPEG library (libjpeg) (RECOMMENDED)'
     The GUI library uses this to handle loading JPEG images.

`The PNG library (libpng) (RECOMMENDED)'
     The GUI library uses this to handle loading PNG images.

`libaudiofile (RECOMMENDED)'
     The GUI library uses this for the sound server

`freetype2 (RECOMMENDED, REQUIRED for art backend)'
     This is used for font information

`libart_lgpl2 (REQUIRED for art backend only)'
     Drawing library for the art backend.

`WindowMaker (Version >= 0.62) (OPTIONAL)'
     GNUstep and WindowMaker work together to provide a consistant
     interface.  Although it is not required, GNUstep will work much
     better if you use it with the WindowMaker window manager.  Get
     WindowMaker from <http://www.windowmaker.org>.

`gnustep-objc package (for gcc version < 3.0 ONLY) (RECOMMENDED)'
     Note: Do not install this library unless you are sure you need it.
     You probably don't need it except on MinGW.  This is a special
     version of the Objective-C runtime that include several bug fixes
     and features that were not in gcc versions previous to 3.0.  It is
     available at <ftp://ftp.gnustep.org/pub/gnustep/libs> which
     compiles using the GNUstep Makefile package (so you don't have to
     get the entire gcc dist). Make sure to set the THREADING variable
     in the GNUmakefile.  It's possible to compile the library static
     (make shared=no) and just copy to the place where the gcc libobjc
     library is (type gcc -v to get this location). Note you have to
     install gnustep-make (below) before installing this library.

`GDB (OPTIONAL)'
     GDB can be obtained from <ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gdb>. As of release
     6.0, gdb has special support for debugging Objective-C programs.

`TeX (OPTIONAL)'
     You need a TeX implementation, like tetex, to compile some of the
     documentation (although most of that is available on the web).

Compiling and Installing the packages
*************************************

Get the following individual packages:

   * gnustep-make

   * gnustep-base

   * gnustep-gui

   * gnustep-back

   See <http://www.gnustep.org> for information on where to get these
packages.

   Make sure you install (if necessary) all the previously mentioned
libraries first before configuring and building GNUstep.

   You should install these packages as root (read special note for the
gnustep-base library, below, if you cannot do this).

   For installation on specific systems, read the machine specific
instructions at the end of this document or appropriate README files in
the gnustep-make Documentation directory (such as README.MingW for
Windows).

Installing the Core Libraries
=============================

The GNUstep packages uses the Autoconf mechanism for configuration; it
checks some host capabilties which are used by all GNUstep software.
To configure just type:

     ./configure

   The GNUstep makefile package needs a root directory.  If the
GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT environment variable is set then configure will
determine the root directory from its value (by removing the final
/System path component from it).  You can also specify the root
directory when you run configure with the prefix paramater; the
following command makes /usr/local/GNUstep the root directory:

     ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/GNUstep

   If you do not have the GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT environment variable set
and you do not specify a root directory when running configure, then
configure will use /usr/GNUstep as the default root directory.

Alternate Library Setup
-----------------------

Read the installation instructions in the Makefile package (make) for
more installation options. Make sure you use the same configuration
options when configuring each GNUstep library.

Building the Package
--------------------

To build the individual packages, use this familiar set of commands for
each pacakge (add any additional options you decide upon):

     ./configure
     make
     make install

   Start with the Makefile Pacakge (gnustep-make). After installing
gnustep-make you need to execute GNUstep's shell configuration script,
as follows:

      . /usr/GNUstep/System/Library/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh

   before proceeding any further.

   NOTE for gcc 2.X or MinGW users: Now install gnustep-objc. Before
building gnustep-objc, edit the `GNUmakefile' and set the THREADING
variable to the thread library used on your system (usually its posix,
but you can leave it at single if you don't need threads). At this point
you should probably re-configure, make and install gnustep-make, so it
can pick up on any threading information that gnustep-objc provides.

   Now install gnustep-base, gnustep-gui and finally gnustep-back.

   NOTE: If you are trying to install the packages without root
permission, you may need to change one thing in the base library. Edit
the file gnustep-base/Tools/gdomap.h to uncomment the last line and
modify the specified port number to a port which you _know_ is not in
use on your network.  You should only do this if absolutely necessary
since making this change will break communications with any systems
where an identical change has not been made.  Also, the standard gdomap
port is the one officially registered with IANA and is reserved for use
by gdomap - it should only be changed if you can't get your system
administrator to start the gdomap server using it.

Additional Installation
***********************

Environment Setup
=================

Add the shell script `GNUstep.sh' located in the Makefile package to
your shell startup file (such as `.profile'). For instance, if your
GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT is `/usr/GNUstep/System',

     . /usr/GNUstep/System/Library/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh

   in your `.profile' file will work (Note the period at the beginning
of the line, and the space between the period and the following path;
if your GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT is different, you need to replace
`/usr/GNUstep/System' with your GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT).  It defines
environment variables that are needed to find GNUstep files and
executables.  Users of csh need to use the `GNUstep.csh' script. Read
the make package `README' for more info. Some systems, like GNU/Linux
have an `/etc/profile.d' directory where scripts can be executed
automatically. If you want to set up GNUstep for every user on your
system, you can try copying/linking the `GNUstep.sh' there. For csh or
tcsh, try

     source /usr/GNUstep/System/Library/Makefiles/GNUstep.csh

GNUstep Home
============

Set up your home GNUstep directory. This should be done automatically
if you don't do it. This is where user defaults are kept as well as
other user configuration files. User installed apps, libraries, etc are
also here (if the default user directory is used).

     cd
     mkdir GNUstep

Time Zone
=========

Next, set your local time zone.  There are four ways to do this, pick
one (see
`$GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT/Library/Libraries/Resources/gnustep-bsae/NSTimeZones/zones'
for typical time zones):

  1. Use the defaults utility to set "Local Time Zone" to your local
     time zone (defaults is installed with GNUstep in the Tools
     directory). Type something like "defaults write NSGlobalDomain
     "Local Time Zone" GB".

  2. Set the GNUSTEP_TZ environment variable.

  3. Create the file
     `$GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT/Library/Libraries/Resources/gnustep-base/NSTimeZones/localtime'
     with the name of the local time zone in it.

  4. Set the TZ environment variable (this may conflict with other
     software on your system though).

GNUstep deamons
===============

Set up your system to execute some GNUstep deamons. If you don't do
this, they will be started automatically when you run your first GNUstep
app:

   * gdomap - Put this in a system startup file, like `/etc/rc.local'
     or `/etc/rc.d/rc.local' (customize for your system)
          GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT=/usr/GNUstep/System
          if [ -f $GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT/Tools/gdomap ]; then
            $GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT/Tools/gdomap
          fi

   * gdnc - Start after sourcing `GNUstep.sh' (e.g. in .profile)

   * gpbs - Same as with gdnc, make sure X-Windows is running.

     if [ `gdomap -L GDNCServer | grep -c Unable` == 1 ]; then
       echo "Starting GNUstep services..."
       gdnc
       gpbs
     fi

Test Tools and Applications
***************************

Test programs for the base library are in `base/Testing'. Example
applications are located in the gstep-examples package.  To make these,
just uncompress and untar this package, cd to the appropriate
directory, and type make. You will need to install the GNUstep core
libraries first before doing this.

   To run the examples. Use the openapp utility that is part of the
GNUstep makefile package (and stored in `$GNUSTEP_SYSTEM_ROOT/Tools').
Usage is:

     openapp application [additional arguments to app]

   Good Luck!

Machine Specific Instructions
*****************************

\input texinfo

   Below is a list of machines that people have attempted to compile
GNUstep on. GNUstep compiles with little or no trouble on many of the
more popular operating systems. Some machines marked with _Unstable_
may have some trouble or may not work at all.  Platforms marked _Needs
Testing_ are not actively tested by developers and need someone to help
with reporting problems and fixes.  Platforms marked _Obsolete_ are
very old distributions. No one really knows if GNUstep works on these
although they may.

   A recommended compiler is listed for each machine, if known. You
should try to use the recommended compiler for compiling GNUstep, as
GNUstep is quite complex and tends provoke a lot of errors in some
compilers. Even versions newer than the listed compiler may not work,
so don't just get the latest version of a compiler expecting it to be
better than previous versions.

   Compiler notes: If a recommended compiler is not listed, take note
of the following information before choosing the compiler you use.
`egcs or gcc < 2.95'
     Might work, but few people use these now.

`gcc 2.95.x'
     Probably the oldest compiler that GNUstep is regularly tested with.

`gcc 2.96'
     Not an official gcc release. Some versions (Redhat, Mandrake) have
     problems that prevent GNUstep from being compiled correctly and
     cause mysterious errors.

`gcc 3.0.x'
     A fairly good compiler. Recommended.

`gcc 3.1'
     Several bugs where introduced in the version. It's probably better
     to avoid this one, although it might work fine.

`gcc 3.2.x'
     Pretty good. Recommended.

`gcc 3.3.x'
     Recommended. Fixes some bugs relating to protocols as well as other
     improvements.

`gcc 3.4'
     No info yet.

   If you have compiled GNUstep on a specific machine, please send
information about what you needed and any special instructions needed to
GNUstep <bug-gnustep@gnu.org>.

   If your having mysterious trouble with a machine, try compiling
GNUstep without optimization. Particularly in the newer GCC compilers,
optimization can break some code. The easiest way to do this is when
configuring, `CFLAGS="" ./configure'. Or when building, `make
OPTFLAG=""'.

   Also if you manually upgraded gcc and/or make, we recommend reading
the documentation at <http://www.LinuxFromScratch.org> for tips on
compiling and installing gcc and make. If you had GNUstep previously
installed, make sure you completely remove all of it, including
installed init scripts.

Darwin/ix86
===========

Currently tested on Darwin 7.x

`Recommended compiler'
     gcc 3.3.2. Older versions will not compile on Darwin.

     Default compiler has unknown problems.  Use the GNU runtime.
     Download the gcc compiler and configure it with
     -enable-threads=posix. You don't need binutils or anything else.

`Extra libs needed'

`Special Instructions'
     Read the <README.Darwin> file in the gnustep-make/Documentation
     directory for complete instructions.


Darwin/PowerPC
==============

Currently tested on Darwin 6.x, 7.x

`Recommended compiler'
     gcc 3.3.2. Older versions will not compile on Darwin.

     Default compiler has unknown problems.  Use the GNU runtime.
     Download the gcc compiler and configure it with
     -enable-threads=posix. You don't need binutils or anything else.

`Extra libs needed'
     Use libffi (not ffcall). This should be enabled by default in
     gnustep-base so you don't have to type -enable-libffi. For 6.x,
     you need the dlcompat library (from <www.opendarwin.org>) to load
     bundles (not needed for 7.x).

`Special Instructions'
     Read the <README.Darwin> file in the gnustep-make/Documentation
     directory for complete instructions.

`Special Instructions'
     Can install via /usr/ports/devel/gnustep, but not all required
     dependancies are installed. See the GNUstep-HOWTO for list of
     libraries.


FreeBSD 4.x
===========

`Recommended compiler'

`Extra libs needed'
     Unknown

`Special Instructions'
     If you're using zsh, some shell variables may not be set correctly
     when executing GNUstep.sh. Try turing on SH_WORD_SPLIT (e.g. 'zsh
     -sh-word-split', 'zsh -o shwordsplit', 'zsh -y' or by setting
     'setopt SH_WORD_SPLIT' in one of zsh's startup files.)

     For gcc 3.0.4, make WANT_THREADS_SUPPORT=YES

     For libxml2 2.4.24, make WITHOUT_PYTHON=YES


FreeBSD 3.x
===========

Compiles "out of the box" on FreeBSD 3.4.

`Recommended compiler'
     gcc 2.95.2

`Extra libs needed'
     Unknown

`Special Instructions'
     You need to use gmake not make to compile the GNUstep packages. A
     special port of gdb can be used with the Objective-C patches from
     <ftp://ftp.pcnet.com/users/eischen/FreeBSD/gdb-4.17-port.tar.gz>

     The best compiler for GNUstep is the latest release of the GNU
     Compiler Collection (GCC).  You can find it at
     <http://egcs.cygnus.com/>.

     If you want to use the native POSIX threads support from `libc_r'
     pass `--enable-threads=posix' to configure.  This is the
     recommended option as this is the FreeBSD threads package that
     gives the best results -with others you may be unable to run some
     examples like `diningPhilosophers'.

     The whole compilation process can fail if you have another threads
     library installed so watch out for installed packages like `pth'
     and such.  Besides the support for libc_r, GNUstep will also look
     for `pth' and `pcthreads', so if you have installed them and they
     aren't detected prepare to write a nice bug report.

     This can be done more much easily by using the port version.  Just
     `cd' to `/usr/ports/lang/egcs' and do a `"make WANT_THREADS=yes
     install"'.  Easy.

     If configure cannot find tiff.h or the tiff library and you have
     it installed in a non-standard place (even `/usr/local'), you may
     need to pass these flags to configure:
     `CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include"' and `LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib"'.


FreeBSD 2.x (_Obsolete,Unstable_)
=================================

`Recommended compiler'
     gcc 2.8.x

`Extra libs needed'
     Unknown

`Special Instructions'
     Only static libraries work on this system.  Use /stand/sysinstall
     to install these packages if you have not already done so:

     gmake           (GNU make)
     gcc 2.8.x

     Seems to compile ok, but some tests crash. Possibly due to a
     performace 'hack' in base. Might be a good idea to upgrade to
     FreeBSD 3.x.  You need to use gmake not make to compile the
     GNUstep packages.


Irix 6.5/MIPS
=============

`Recommended compiler'
     gcc 3.2.1

     To use threads, it's necessary to bootstrap a compiler yourself:
     configure with -enable-threads=posix, that will work as long as you
     link EVERY objective C executable with -lpthread, no matter what
     warnings the irix linker produces!

`Extra libs needed'
     Unknown

`Special Instructions'
     If you cannot link the library because of the very low default
     limit (20480) for the command line length, then you should either
     use systune ncargs to increase the value (maximum is 262144) or
     link the library by hand.  No libffi-support: Use ffcall


MacOSX/PowerPC
==============

Currently tested on MacOSX 10.2, 10.3

`Recommended compiler'
     Default.

`Extra libs needed'
     None.

`Special Instructions'
     By default, on Mac OS X, only the GNUstep extensions are built.
     This is if you want to build gdl2, etc on Mac OS X. Xcode project
     files exist, but they may not be up-to-date. Try:

          cd make
          ./configure --with-library-combo=apple-apple-apple
          make install
          
          cd ../base
          ./configure --with-xml-prefix=/usr --disable-xmltest
          make debug=yes install


   See also the Darwin/PowerPC section.

MkLinux/PowerPC
===============

Tested with R2 RC2 (2004/03/04).

`Recommended compiler'
     gcc 3.x allthough earlier ones should work if you also install
     gnustep-objc

`Extra libs needed'
     None.

`Special Instructions'
     Unknown.

OpenBSD 3.x  (_Needs Testing_)
==============================

`Recommended compiler'
     Unknown

`Extra libs needed'
     Unknown

`Special Instructions'
     Try reading the <README.NetBSD> which might work the same on
     OpenBSD.

OSF Alpha  (_Unstable_)
=======================

Information is for Version 3.2C

`Recommended compiler'
     egcs-1.1.1/1.1.2, gcc-2.95

`Extra libs needed'
     Unknown

`Special Instructions'
     Can only compile with static libraries. Compiler may fail when
     linking executables (e.g. gdnc). Standard ranlib and ar programs
     are to feable to create libraries. Should use GNU binutils
     versions. Linker sometimes fails to find symbols, in which case
     you may need to link with a library twice. For instance, add an
     extra -lgnustep-gui in ADDTIONAL_TOOL_LIBS in the
     GNUmakefile(.preamble).


RedHat/Intel
============

`Recommended compiler'
     Standard

`Extra libs needed'
     Standard (ffcall or libffi)

`Special Instructions'
     None

Slackware/Intel

Solaris 2.5.1/Sparc (_Obsolete_)
================================

This configuration is no longer being tested, but it may still work.

`Recommended compiler'
     Unknown

`Extra libs needed'
     tiff, Don't use the one in /usr/openwin

`Special Instructions'
     See the Solaris 2.6 section for more instructions.

Solaris 2.[67]/Sparc
====================

`Recommended compiler'
     gcc 3.2.1 gcc 2.95.3. Version 2.95.2 has several bugs that GNUstep
     tickles.  gcc 3.04. Not 3.1 - does not compile parts of GNUstep.

`Extra libs needed'
     tiff, Don't use the one in /usr/openwin

`Special Instructions'
     No libffi-support unless you use the patch
     <http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/java-patches/2002-q3/msg00036.html> (not
     particularly recommended).

     Using a POSIX shell (zsh or bash, which should come with Solaris)
     is highly recommended. In fact, some functions, such as compiling
     frameworks, will not work without it.


   Some people have reported problems when using binutils assembler and
linker.  Using the native Solaris assmebler and linker should work fine.

   Older Instructions: If you are using threads, make sure the
Objective-C runtime (libobjc that comes with gcc) is compiled with
threads enabled (This is true by default) AND that it is compiled with
the _REENTRANT flag defined (This does not seem to be true by default).
Or use the gnustep-objc package. Also make sure THREADS is set to
'posix' not 'solaris'.

Solaris 2.7/Intel
=================

`Recommended compiler'
     Unknown.

`Extra libs needed'
     Unknown

`Special Instructions'
     Make sure there are no -g compiler flags (i.e. compiling with
     debug=yes might be a problem). Unsure of correct bundle flags -
     You might need to use the alternate flags listed in target.make,
     line 989. Also, configuring gnustep-make with
     `--disable-backend-bundle' might be necessary if you can't get
     bundles to work.  You will probable get a lot of text relocation
     warnings, which probably can be ignored. See the other Solaris
     instructions above for more information.


Suse 6.x/Intel
==============

GNUstep has been tested on version 6.2-6.4 of Suse

`Recommended compiler'
     Standard

`Extra libs needed'
     None

`Special Instructions'
     It seems that there is a problem with the default kernel build
     distributed with Suse  which means that the socket binding used by
     gdnc doesn't work.  If you recompile the kernel then it starts
     working.


Suse/Intel
==========

GNUstep has been tested on version 7.0, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2, 9.0, and 9.1 of
Suse

`Recommended compiler'
     The default compiler that comes with Susu is fine. Also gcc2.95.x,
     gcc3.0.x, 3.1 and 3.2 work, but 2.95 is faster.  Compile with
     -threads-enabled (non-standard).

`Extra libs needed'
     None

`Special Instructions'
     None.


Suse 7.x/PPC
============

GNUstep has been tested on version 7.0 of Suse/PPC

`Recommended compiler'
     Standard. gcc2.95.x, gcc3.0.x and gc3.1 work, but 2.95 is faster.
     Compile with -threads-enabled (non-standard).

`Extra libs needed'
     None

   Special Instructions for GNUstep installation on Unixware 2.1 systems

1
     Tune the kernel to increase the argument space so that we can pass
     long command-line argument strings to processes (which the
     makefiles do) (/etc/conf/bin/idtune ARG_MAX 102400)

2
     Install raft of the latest GNU software

     gzip            (you need this to unpack other stuff)
     make            (to build everything)
     m4              (for autoconf etc)
     autoconf        (if you need to change anything)
     bison
     flex
     binutils        (required by gcc if you want to debug)
     gcc-2.8.1
                     (configure --with-gnu-as --with-gnu-ld --with-stabs)
                     NB. gcc-2.8.1 needs a fix to __do_global_dtors_aux()
                     in crtstuff.c on Unixware 2.1.3
                     (and possibly other unixware versions)
                     The fix is already in recent versions of egcs.

          ==================================
          static void
          __do_global_dtors_aux ()
          {
            static func_ptr *p = __DTOR_LIST__ + 1;
            static int completed = 0;
          
            if (completed)
              return;
          
            while (*p)
              {
                p++;
                (*(p-1)) ();
              }
          
          #ifdef EH_FRAME_SECTION_ASM_OP
            __deregister_frame_info (__EH_FRAME_BEGIN__);
          #endif
            completed = 1;
          }
          ======================================

     Having got gcc working - it's probably a good idea to rebuild all
     your GNU software using it!

4
     Build gstep as normal.

5
     The SIOCGIFCONF ioctl sometimes doesn't work on unixware after
     applying some of the OS patches.

     So I have added a '-a' flag to gdomap to give it the name of a file
     containing IP address and netmask information for the network
     interfaces on the system.

     You need to set up a file (I suggest '/etc/gdomap_addresses')
     containing the information for your machine and modify your system
     startup files in /etc/rc?.d to run gdomap, telling it to use that
     file.

     eg. If your machine has an IP address of '193.111.111.2' and is on
     a class-C network, your /etc/gdomap_addresses file would contain
     the line

          193.111.111.2 255.255.255.0

     and your startup file would contain the lines

          . /usr/local/GNUstep/Library/Makefiles/GNUstep.sh
          gdomap -a /etc/gdomap_addresses


   If you don't set gdomap up correctly, Distributed Objects will not
work.

Windows with CYGWIN (_Needs Testing_)
=====================================

`Recommended compiler'
     gcc 3.3.1 or later (with libobjc and libjava (if using libffi))

`Extra libs needed'
     Objective-C library DLL
     (<ftp://ftp.gnustep.org/pub/gnustep/windows/cygwin>) for shared
     libs. It's a good idea to remove the libobjc.a that comes with gcc
     (gcc -v for location) so that it isn't accidentally found.  For
     ffcall, you should get version 1.8b or above (the earlier ones
     don't compile). There are still some problems with structure
     passing, but that is generally not supported on any architecture.
     libffi also works.

`Special Instructions'
     Make sure you have good shared libraries for everthing. Sometimes
     a bad shared library (like libtiff) will cause odd and untraceable
     problems.  See <README.Cygwin> for information on compiling.


Windows with MinGW
==================

`Recommended compiler'
     See below.

`Extra libs needed'
     See below.

`Special Instructions'
     See the <README.MinGW> file located in the gnustep-make
     Documentation directory for instructions. Windows NT/2000/XP only.
     Win98 machines and earlier are very buggy and are not supported.
     Native GUI backend is alpha version.

Yellowdog/PowerPC
=================

`Recommended compiler'
     Standard

`Extra libs needed'
     Standard (ffcall or libffi)

Getting Libraries via Anonymous CVS
***********************************

If you didn't get one of the snapshots, or if you want to be sure to
stay on the bleading edge, then you should get the libraries via CVS. Go
to <http://savannah.gnu.org/cvs/?group_id=99> for information on how to
get anonymous CVS access.

   If you haven't already done so, change to the directory, where you
want the source to reside. To get a list of potential modules to check
out, type
     cvs -z3 checkout -c

   For instance, to check our `core', which contains all the GNUstep
code libraries:
     cvs -z3 checkout core

   After you have checked out the source you can compile it as usual.
To update the source, go into the directory of the source tree you want
to update, for example, go into 'base', and type:

     cvs -z3 update -Pd

   You don't have to re-checkout after you have the source, just update!
